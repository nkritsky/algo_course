# We are given a linked list where the node has two pointers. The first is the regular next pointer. 
# The second pointer is called arbitrary_pointer and it can point to any node in the linked list.
# Your job is to write code to make a deep copy of the given linked list. Here, deep copy means that any operations on
# the original list (inserting, modifying and removing) should not affect the copied list.
